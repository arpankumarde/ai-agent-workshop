# AI Agents

An AI Agent is a software entity that performs tasks autonomously using artificial intelligence techniques. AI Agents can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

## Basic Components of AI Agents

1. **Agents**: Autonomous entities that interact with their environment to achieve specific goals.
2. **Models**: Mathematical representations or algorithms that enable agents to make predictions or decisions.
3. **Tools**: Software or hardware resources that assist agents in performing tasks.
4. **Knowledge**: Information and data that agents use to make informed decisions.
5. **Chunking**: The process of breaking down information into manageable pieces for easier processing.
6. **VectorDbs**: Databases that store data in vector format, enabling efficient similarity searches and retrieval.
7. **Storage**: Systems for storing data and information that agents can access and use.
8. **Embeddings**: Representations of data in a continuous vector space, often used for natural language processing and machine learning tasks.
9. **Workflows**: Sequences of tasks or processes that agents follow to achieve their goals.

## Types of AI Agents

1. **Reactive Agents**: These agents respond to stimuli from the environment without using internal states.
2. **Deliberative Agents**: These agents use internal models and reasoning to make decisions.
3. **Hybrid Agents**: These agents combine reactive and deliberative approaches to leverage the strengths of both.

## How AI Agents Differ from Large Language Models (LLMs)

While both AI Agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) are components of artificial intelligence, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

1. **Purpose**:

   - **AI Agents**: Designed to perform specific tasks autonomously by interacting with their environment.
   - **LLMs**: Primarily used for understanding and generating human language.

2. **Functionality**:

   - **AI Agents**: Can perceive, reason, learn, and act to achieve goals.
   - **LLMs**: Focus on processing and generating text based on patterns learned from large datasets.

3. **Components**:

   - **AI Agents**: Include perception, reasoning, learning, action, and communication components.
   - **LLMs**: Consist of neural network architectures trained on vast amounts of text data.

4. **Applications**:

   - **AI Agents**: Used in autonomous vehicles, robotics, personal assistants, etc.
   - **LLMs**: Used in chatbots, language translation, text summarization, etc.

5. **Interaction**:
   - **AI Agents**: Interact with the physical or digital environment to perform tasks.
   - **LLMs**: Interact primarily through text-based inputs and outputs.

Understanding these differences helps in choosing the right approach for specific AI applications.

## Getting Started
